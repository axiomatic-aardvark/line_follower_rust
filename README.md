Rusty Line Follower ðŸ¦€
==================

Line follower robot built with Rust, utilising the [avr-hal](https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal-template) project. For now it only supports the Arduino Uno board, but the code can easily be adapted for other boards with the help of the [avr-hal examples](https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal/tree/main/examples).

## Usage
First, Install `avrdude`. The steps for that will depend on your OS.

Then clone this repo:
```
git clone git@github.com:axiomatic-aardvark/rusty-line-follower.git
```

Everything is prepared so you should be able to just run the project:

```bash
cargo run
```
